        We have turned a dis-used bowling green into a biodiverse garden for
        everyone to enjoy. We are in a corner of Nightingale Park/Rec, across
        the Hills Road from Addenbrooke's hospital and biomedical campus in
        South Cambridge.

        Funding the garden project: We have been successful making applications
        for funding for the larger changes to the garden, but needed additional
        funding for everyday expenses like our annual insurance and smaller new
        projects. In August 2021, we started a Friends Group, which has been
        great: all welcome to join. It has a Newsletter, which is also available
        online.

        In May 2018, we started a constituted group (with its own bank account),
        Nightingale Community Gardeners.
